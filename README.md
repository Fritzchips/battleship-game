## Summary

This full-stack application was a step away from my comfort zone. Every project I had done before this was through the frontend with React, basic HTML, CSS and JS. A few problems I solved and learned along the way were:

- setting up development environment with React and NodeJS/Express
- serving react static files
- setting up connection with Twitter API using Express
- connecting server and UI endpoints

Perseverance and guidance from the Software Development Mastermind Group helped me overcome some of my most difficult obstacles. I feel a lot more confident with this introduction to the backend. This is a project that I'm proud of making.
