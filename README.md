## Summary

I've been learning `JavaScript` up to this point, but now I am diving into `C#` to develop my backend skills. This was a great learning experience to `Object Oriented Programming` and the general basics of C#. 
I learned that Javascript and C# on the base level are similar but C# is more explicit about their variables allowing less room for error. Having a first look at `Encapsulation`, `Abstraction`,`Inheritance`, and `Polymorphism`
has opened my mind to the different possibilities OOP could accomplish. C# is a powerful tool that I'm excited to learn in my journey as I move into `.NET CORE` applications.
